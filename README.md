# XCL Web Application Platform

[![Project Status: Active ‚Äì The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/2.0.0/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## :construction: 2019-01-29 XCL update to PHP7  
The new **XCL** development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues and the design process is simplified to extend the Web Application Platform.

## :information_source: The App


**The XCL** is a simple, secure and scalable web application platform. The modular architecture is built in PHP with Cube core, SQL and a smarty theming system. The graphical user interface empowers everyone to create dynamic and content rich apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript - from the best looking blogs, forums, portfolios, intranet and business websites to the much safer desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is friendly managed, developed and supported by a volunteer group with a multidisciplinary focus to provide a variety of different perspectives and ideas to consider in further development and design. XCL Team Core values are integrity, innovation, passion and respect. When you know who you are, you know what to do, you know what story to tell and the stories that you want to hear. We share the essential knowledge and understanding of the ‚Äúspirit of open source‚Äù necessary to create tools that encourage creativity.
