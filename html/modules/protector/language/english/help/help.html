<h4>Module Protector</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Protector is a module developed by Gijoe to improve the security of a website,
	and is widely regarded as a ‘must have’ module. Protector is capable of defending against:</p>
<ul>
	<li> denial of service (DOS) attacks, bandwidth-hungry crawlers and spambots.</li>
	<li>SQL injection, variable contamination, null bytes, session hijacking, and some kinds of cross-site scripting.</li>
	<li>Brute force attacks and directory traversals.</li>
	<li>Uploading of camouflaged image files and executables.</li>
	<li>Link and comment spammers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Protector logs the attacking IPs and offers a range of countermeasures including IP bans, blank screens and automatic sanitisation of attempted injections etc.
	Protector also evaluates your site for certain vulnerabilities and providing warnings about them through a ‘security advisory’ page, and provides instructions on how to fix them.
